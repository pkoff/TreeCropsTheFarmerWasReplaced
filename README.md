The code works in a matrix that is NxN, N being the result of the comand get_world_size(), the trees planted by the code, grow faster when not in contact with other trees in the spaces North, South, West and East of the place were the tree is planted, so the code plants other crops instead of trees, so it can farm all other crops while growing trees fast.

Remember, this code only works in the game The Farmer Was Replaced, because it utilizes functions exclusives of the game in topic.
